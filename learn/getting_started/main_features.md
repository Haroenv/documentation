# Main Features

[[toc]]

Questions: (Answers in italics)

1. Do we add warnings and notes at this stage? *Nope*
2. Do we add links to detailed explanations at every instance? Or do we add them only once at the bottom of each section? *Only once*
3. What should the feature examples look like? Do we start with a presenting a use case? Suppose you want to blah blah and demonstrate how MeiliSearch does it? Add a code sample. *To be decided*
4. Do we want a section at the start briefly explaining MeiliSearch terms and any other terms? Documents, indexes, attributes, any other terms used in getting started? *Nope*
5. Where does the dataset file go? Not sure if we need it
6. Should I use "we" or "you"? *You*

This section will go over some of the main features of MeiliSearch to help you get started.

Once you have everything set up, you can change the default settings .... need a better sentence to summarize the whole thing.

## Starting your journey

### Download and install

:::: tabs

::: tab cURL
Download the **latest stable release** of MeiliSearch with **cURL**.

Launch MeiliSearch to start the server.

```bash
# Install MeiliSearch
curl -L https://install.meilisearch.com | sh

# Launch MeiliSearch
./meilisearch
```

:::

::: tab Homebrew
Download the **latest stable release** of MeiliSearch with **Homebrew**.

Launch MeiliSearch to start the server.

```bash
# Update brew and install MeiliSearch
brew update && brew install meilisearch

# Launch MeiliSearch
meilisearch
```

:::

::: tab Docker
Using **Docker** you can choose to run [any available tag](https://hub.docker.com/r/getmeili/meilisearch/tags).

This command starts the **latest stable release** of MeiliSearch.

```bash
# Fetch the latest version of MeiliSearch image from DockerHub
docker pull getmeili/meilisearch:latest

# Launch MeiliSearch
docker run -it --rm \
    -p 7700:7700 \
    -v $(pwd)/data.ms:/data.ms \
    getmeili/meilisearch:latest
```

Data written to a **Docker container is not persistent** and is deleted along with the container when the latter is stopped. Docker volumes are not deleted when containers are removed. It is then recommended to share volumes between your containers and your host machine to provide persistent storage. MeiliSearch writes data to `/data.ms`

You can learn more about Docker on the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
:::

::: tab APT

Download the **latest stable release** of MeiliSearch with **APT**.

Launch MeiliSearch to start the server.

```bash
# Add MeiliSearch package
echo "deb [trusted=yes] https://apt.fury.io/meilisearch/ /" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/fury.list

# Update APT and install MeiliSearch
apt update && apt install meilisearch-http

# Launch MeiliSearch
meilisearch
```

:::

::: tab Source

MeiliSearch is written in `Rust`. To compile it, [installing the Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) is required.

If the Rust toolchain is already installed, clone the repository on your local system and change it to your working directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/meilisearch/MeiliSearch
cd MeiliSearch
```

In the cloned repository, compile MeiliSearch.

```bash
# Update the rust toolchain to the latest version
rustup update

# Compile the project
cargo build --release

# Execute the server binary
./target/release/meilisearch
```

:::

::: tab Windows

To install MeiliSearch on Windows, you can:

- use Docker (see "Docker" tab above)
- [download the latest binary](https://github.com/meilisearch/MeiliSearch/releases)
- use the installation script (see "cURL" tab above) if you have installed [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) or equivalent
- compile from source (see "Source" tab above)

To learn more about the Windows command prompt, follow this [introductory guide](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/a-beginners-guide-to-the-windows-command-line/).

::::

### Cloud deploy

To deploy MeiliSearch on a cloud service, follow one of our dedicated guides:

- [AWS](/create/how_to/aws.md)
- [DigitalOcean](/create/how_to/digitalocean_droplet.md)
- [Qovery](/create/how_to/qovery.md)

### Add documents

Now that MeiliSearch is up and running, the next step is adding documents. A [document]((/learn/core_concepts/documents.md)) is an object that contains data in the form of one or more fields. MeiliSearch currently accepts documents in the JSON, NDJSON, and CSV formats.

Your documents are stored in an [index](/learn/core_concepts/indexes.md). If the index does not exist, MeiliSearch creates it when you first add documents.

To add documents to an index called `movies`, use:

<CodeSamples id="getting_started_add_documents_md" />

Here's an example of the kind of response you should receive after adding documents.

```json
{
    "uid": 0,
    "indexUid": "movies",
    "status": "enqueued",
    "type": "documentsAddition",
    "enqueuedAt": "2021-08-11T09:25:53.000000Z"
}
```

Document addition is an [asynchronous](/learn/advanced/asynchronous_operations.md) operation. All asynchronous operations return the above response indicating that the operation has been taken into account and will be processed once it reaches the front of the queue.

You can use the `uid` to view additional details on the [tasks progress](/reference/api/tasks.md).

### Basic search

Now that you have MeiliSearch setup, you can start searching! MeiliSearch [offers many parameters](/reference/features/search_parameters.md) that you can play with to refine your search or change the format of the returned documents. However, by default, the search is already relevant.

<CodeSamples id="getting_started_search_md" />

MeiliSearch **response**:

```json
{
  "hits": [
    {
      "id": "29751",
      "title": "Batman Unmasked: The Psychology of the Dark Knight",
      "poster": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/jjHu128XLARc2k4cJrblAvZe0HE.jpg",
      "overview": "Delve into the world of Batman and the vigilante justice tha",
      "release_date": "2008-07-15"
    },
    {
      "id": "471474",
      "title": "Batman: Gotham by Gaslight",
      "poster": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/7souLi5zqQCnpZVghaXv0Wowi0y.jpg",
      "overview": "ve Victorian Age Gotham City, Batman begins his war on crime",
      "release_date": "2018-01-12"
    },
    â€¦
  ],
  "offset": 0,
  "limit": 20,
  "processingTimeMs": 2,
  "query": "botman"
}
```

### Web interface

## Configuration options

MeiliSearch allows you to configure your entire instance through **environment variables** and **command-line options**. You can configure your instance with environment variables before launch and with command line options at launch.

This chapter covers some of the important configuration options but you can read about all of them in our [configuration guide](/reference/features/configuration.md).

### Database path

By default, all your database files will be created in a folder called `data.ms`. You can configure this using the `MEILI_DB_PATH` environment variable or the `--db-path` CLI option.

### Environment

You can run your MeiliSearch instance in `production` or `development`. By default, it runs in `development`, you can change that using the `MEILI_ENV` environment variable or the `--env` CLI option.

### Master key

You can protect your MeiliSearch instance by setting a master key. You can configure this using the `MEILI_MASTER_KEY` environment variable or the `--master-key` CLI option. MeiliSearch requires a master key when the `--env` is set to `production`.

### Payload limit size

MeiliSearch accepts JSON, NDJSON, and CSV payloads. The default payload limit is 104857600 (~100MB) but you can update it using the `MEILI_HTTP_PAYLOAD_SIZE_LIMIT` environment variable or the `--http-payload-size-limit` CLI option.

## Relevancy

### stop words and synonyms

- Is it a good idea to link one-way association or should it be the Synonyms page? This link does take the user to the synonyms page so it shouldn't be a problem
- Do I need to include examples? I don't think so. The Synonyms and Stop words pages are pretty brief, too much info here will make them useless. But is this detail enough for demonstration purposes? Maybe add a gif and update the examples I used in the text accordingly?
- Not sure if gifs is a good idea for stop words. Any suggestions?

MeiliSearch allows you to create a list of words that is ignored in your search queries. These words are called stop words. A good example is the word `the` in English.

If you search for `the cat` with the current settings, MeiliSearch will return a lot of results but not all of them will be relevant. After adding `the` to your list of stop words, MeiliSearch will ignore all documents containing `the` and return the ones with `cat` improving the speed and relevancy of your search.

You can read more about stop words in our [dedicated guide](/reference/features/stop_words.md).

A list of synonyms is useful if you have multiple words with the same meaning in your dataset. This will make your search results more relevant. So if you have `winnie` and `piglet` set as synonyms, searching for either words will show the same results.

-> Need to create a gif

The only exception is one-way association, you can read more about it in our [dedicated guide](/reference/features/synonyms.md#one-way-association).

### ranking rules

- What kind of example goes here?

MeiliSearch sorts search responses based on a set of consecutive rules called ranking rules. You can update these ranking rules for each index. The default order for the ranking rules is as follows:

1. Words
2. Typo
3. Proximity
4. Attribute
5. Sort
6. Exactness

You can read more about them in our [dedicated guide](/learn/core_concepts/relevancy.md).

### Displayed attributes

By default, all attributes are displayed in each matching document but you can update the settings to change that. If you access the MeiliSearch web interface at `http://127.0.0.1:7700/`, you will notice that you can view all of the attributes in the `movies` index.

![Web interface with default displayed attributes](/getting-started/default_displayed_attributes.png)

If you only want to view the `title`, `poster`, and `overview`, you can do so with the following query:

<CodeSamples id= "getting_started_update_displayedAttributes_md" />

![Web interface with updated displayed attributes](/getting-started/updated_displayed_attributes.png)  

### distinctAttribute

MeiliSearch lets you set one field per index as the distinct attribute. The distinct attribute will always be unique among returned documents. This means there will never be more than one occurrence of the same value in the distinct attribute field among the returned documents.

-> no idea what the example should be

### Searchable attributes

By default, all attribute are searched for matching query words but you can configure the settings to change that. Lets look at MeiliSearch's web interface for this example.
When we search for `lion king` with the default settings, MeiliSearch searches for it everywhere.

Use a number or a common phrase for the example. `Number 23`, `Pi`

![need a better gif](/getting-started/getting_started_searchableAttributes.gif)

If we update the `searchableAttributes` to only contain the movie title, MeiliSearch will only consider the title during search.

new gif

## Search parameters

Even though the search is relevant by default, MeiliSearch offers many parameters that you can play with to refine your search or change the format of the returned document.

This chapter covers some of the important search parameters but you can read about all of them in our [search parameters guide](/reference/features/search_parameters.md).

### attributesToHighlight

### attributesToCrop

By default, MeiliSearch responses return the entire value of all attributes. You can use the `attributesToCrop` parameter to crop the value of selected attributes.

Let's take `overview` as an example, MeiliSearch will return the whole value for it. If you want to only view the first `10` characters(is this the right term), you can use:

### limit

The `limit` decides the maximum number of documents MeiliSearch returns for a query. The default is `20` but you can change it.

If you search the `movies` index for `shifu`, MeiliSearch will return the first 20 movies. If you were to update the limit to `10`:

<CodeSamples id= "getting_started_limit_md" />

MeiliSearch would now return the first ten results.

## Filtering and sorting

### Filterable attributes

MeiliSearch allows you to refine your search using filters. You can use any of the document fields for filtering by adding them to the `filterableAttributes`.

### Sortable attributes

- I'm not sure how to the example part should go? For now I can only think of "Let's ..." but is that peppy enough?
- Link to sorting guide

You can use any (not any-do we need the details here? (if it fits in a sentence)) of the document fields for sorting by adding them to the `sortableAttributes`. Let's look at how you can sort all `H5` meteors based on their mass.

<CodeSamples id= "getting_started_sorting_md" />

-> Add json result here

Maybe mention asc and desc rules.

To learn more about `sortableAttributes` and how to configure them, refer to our [dedicated guide](/reference/features/sorting.md).

### Geosearch

- Can't demonstrate this using a gif so I added the code sample and I don't like this
- Do I add the result for each query? If so, I need to fix the indentation
- Where do I link the dataset?
- Do I need to mention `_geoDistance`?

MeiliSearch allows you to filter and sort results based on their geographic location. To use this feature, your documents need to have the `_geo` field.

Let's say you want to find out the what meteors crashed within a 210km radius of Bern:

<CodeSamples id= "getting_started_geoRadius_md" />

You should get the following meteors:

```json

  }
  ]
  ```

You can also use geosearch to sort results based on their distance from a specific location. Let's say you want to view meteors based on how close they were to the Taj Mahal:

<CodeSamples id= "getting_started_geoPoint_md" />

You should get the following meteors:

## Integration/Facets

- can we use this with the interface?

## Dumps and snapshots

- I think this section gives enough detail for an introduction. If we keep this here, do we get rid of it from Advanced topics?
- I don't think a note is a good idea here, too much detail for a "brief intro".

MeiliSearch allows you to backup your data using `dumps` or `screenshots`.

Dumps allow you to export your MeiliSearch instance. A dump isn't an exact copy of your databaseâ€”it is closer to a blueprint that allows you to create an identical dataset. It contains all your indexes, documents, and settings, but in a raw unprocessed form.

Importing a dump requires MeiliSearch to re-index all of your documents. This process requires an amount of time and memory corresponding to the size of the database (the number of documents, their size, and the complexity of any index settings).

Snapshots, on the other hand, are an exact copy of your database. The documents in a snapshot are already "indexed" and ready to go, greatly increasing import speed. However, as a result, **snapshots are not compatible between different versions of MeiliSearch.**

Snapshots are intended mainly as a safeguard: ensuring that if some failure occurs, you're able to relaunch your database quickly and efficiently.
