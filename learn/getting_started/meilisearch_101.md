# MeiliSearch 101

The purpose of this section is to introduce you to the main features of MeiliSearch. You can refer to the links in each chapter to dive deeper.

This guide picks up right after the [Quick start](/learn/getting_started/quick_start.md). We recommend reading these chapters sequentially. We will be using the command line and the MeiliSearch web interface to demonstrate the following:

- [Filtering and sorting](/learn/getting_started/chapter_1_filtering_and_sorting.md)
- [Customizing relevancy](/learn/getting_started/chapter_2_customizing_relevancy.md)
- [Adding a visual UI](/learn/getting_started/chapter_3_adding_a_visual_UI.md)
- [Configuration and security](/learn/getting_started/chapter_4_configuration_and_security.md)

We will be using the movies and meteors datasets for our examples.
