# MeiliSearch 101

- Do we want the reader to follow these chapters sequentially?
- Do we have any prerequisites? Do we link any datasets we will be using in the upcoming chapters?
- This guide picks up right after the Quick start -> Do I add this to the intro?

The purpose of this section is to introduce you to the main features of MeiliSearch. You can refer to the links in each chapter to dive deeper.

We will be using the command line and MeiliSearch web interface to demonstrate the following:

- [Filtering and sorting](/learn/getting_started/chapter_1_filtering_and_sorting.md)
- [Customizing relevancy](/learn/getting_started/chapter_2_customizing_relevancy.md)
- [Adding a visual UI](/learn/getting_started/chapter_3_adding_a_visual_UI.md)
- [Configuration and security](/learn/getting_started/chapter_4_configuration_and_security.md)

This guide is written for-> do we want to add something like this?
